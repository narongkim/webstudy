<h2> Stardew Valley 개요 </h2>
<p><a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley_Wiki" target="_blank" title = "stardew valley wiki">Stardew Valley</a> is a <strong>simulation role-playing video <u>game</u> </strong>developed by Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone.
It was released for Microsoft Windows in February 2016, and later for macOS, Linux, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation Vita, iOS, and Android. Players take the role of a character who takes over his or her deceased grandfather's dilapidated farm in a place known as Stardew Valley. The game is open-ended, allowing players to take on activities such as growing crops, raising livestock, crafting goods, mining for ores, selling produce, and socializing with the townspeople, including marriage and having children. It also allows up to three other players to play together online.

<p>Barone developed the game by himself over four years. He was heavily inspired by the Harvest Moon video game series, with additions to address some of the shortcomings of those games. He used it as an exercise to improve his own programming and game design skills. British studio Chucklefish approached Barone midway through development with the offer to publish the game, allowing him to focus more on completing it. Stardew Valley was both a critical and commercial success, selling over 10 million copies by 2020.</p>
